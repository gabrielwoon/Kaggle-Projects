    "In the tutorial, you learned about six different types of bias.  In this exercise, you'll train a model with **real data** and get practice with identifying bias.  Don't worry if you're new to coding: you'll still be able to complete the exercise!\n",

    "At the end of 2017, the [Civil Comments](https://medium.com/@aja_15265/saying-goodbye-to-civil-comments-41859d3a2b1d) platform shut down and released their ~2 million public comments in a lasting open archive. Jigsaw sponsored this effort and helped to comprehensively annotate the data.  In 2019, Kaggle held the [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/overview) competition so that data scientists worldwide could work together to investigate ways to mitigate bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cell below loads some of the data from the competition.  We'll work with thousands of comments, where each comment is labeled as either \"toxic\" or \"not toxic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by running the next code cell.  \n",
    "- Clicking inside the code cell.\n",
    "- Click on the triangle (in the shape of a \"Play button\") that appears to the left of the code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will run for approximately 30 seconds.  When it finishes, you should see as output a message saying that the data was successfully loaded, along with two examples of comments: one is toxic, and the other is not."
